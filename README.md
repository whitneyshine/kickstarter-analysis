# kickstarter-analysis<br>
Performing analysis on Kickstarter dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to uncover trends<br>
**Kickstarting with Excel<br><br>**

**Overview of Project<br>**
**Purpose<br>**
When we opened the Module 1 Challenge, the background formed our initial foundation with presenting us that Louise’s play Fever came very close to meeting its fundraising goal in a short time frame.  But there is the hook, what does close mean and how long did they have to try and meet the fundraising goal.  What we learn about Louise is she is very keen as she would like to know the success and/or failures of other campaigns as well as understand the data and analysis around the dates they launched their campaigns as well as uncover what they had set as their funding goals with a drawn conclusion that separates them into categories of successful, failed, or canceled.  
Since Day 1 of Boot Camp, we have been taught that the first step of an analysis is to take an initial look at the data. The point of the first step is to become aware of the data and understand its structure.  We also need to know what the data is telling us so that we are aware of what kind of data we have and what kind of analysis we can derive from the subset.  Before we can prepare any analysis, add data features with charts, or enhance the analysis, we need to know the data is structed and clean.  From there, we can begin to venture into the analysis and feedback of the data to Louise.  Let’s begin.<br>

**Analysis and Challenges<br>**
To begin, the Kickstarter data table contained all the information we needed to form a solid data foundation but not all the format needed to create a detailed data analysis.  The spreadsheet alone is overwhelming and truly does not provide an analytic approach.  What needs to be done is to gear the analysis around the request of Louise – we need to look at campaigns by Launch Date and we also need to analyze the data based on goals.<br>  
**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date<br>**
We know we need to do is become more specific with our data and a Pivot Table will do the trick.  The reason we want to look at months is the same reason retail stores look at their numbers to understand where success and demand intersect, for with that knowledge they will be able to apply that analysis to their next venture.  That is exactly what Louise is wanting to do and to do that we need group and analyze Theater.  For Louise to understand how data supports the decisions as when it is best to launch campaigns, we need group our Theater data into months only – to attach the actual date of the month and which year it occurred would be too overwhelming and frankly, pointless.<br>  .  
**Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals<br>**
The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals was a fantastic exercise.  The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date was too general but provided a necessary foundation for the granularity needed to reveal data trends that could have been analyzed deeper.<br>
The data analysis allowed Louise to see how we could group data into further categories or analysis once we the months that had successful campaigns.  This analysis allows Louise to see what fundraising category the highest or lowest success rate had as well as allowed her to see analytics behind the failed campaigns as well.  To be able to see both sides of the coin is critical in financial planning to see what word and how as well as to have a root cause analysis behind the failures.  Failures bring opportunity to not repeat itself it you commit to learning from it root cause.<br>
The way this data is arranged in the data table as well as in the line chart is brilliantly done.   This chart and data invite me to dig in more to see if other analytics could be performed to connect the two approaches of Launch Date and Outcome of Goals to further uncover the secrets to success.<br>
**Challenges and Difficulties Encountered<br>**
The main challenge or difficulty for me was that this data didn’t tie back to my profession and finding true passion to dive into it or dissect was tough because of the apparent removal of being able to influence or to be influence by the data and analysis.<br>  
I also found it challenging but rewarding to try new ways with Pivot Tables and Graphs.  As I worked through the exercise, I kept pushing myself to stay true to the instruction and learn through growth while being uncomfortable.  Seeing data points come to fruition but not being able to research or explore them as to it not being a part of the assignment was indeed challenge but rewarding know that the reason behind taking this boot camp was having a passion about the data.<br>
Results<br><br>

**What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? <br>**
The first conclusion is to look at the successful campaigns and decipher when did the successes occur.  The best overall month is May with 111 successful campaigns and June comes in very close behind that number with 100.<br>
The second conclusion is that the highest month of failures for campaigns is May with 52.  I find that odd because the month of May holds the highest number of successes and failures but at first blush per the line chart, I really thought October would be the walkaway winner since it shows a sharp peak increase from September.  
Canceled campaigns are very consistent with their proportion except for January – that is a strong data table reveal but the line chart doesn’t accentuate that data.<br>

**What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?<br>**
Outcomes based on Goals shows me that meat of the campaigns landed in the first two goal categories – Less than $1,000 and between $1,000 - $4,999.  Not only did the sample size lie in that criteria, they also found the most percent success as well.  You could really decide to drill down in those areas further to understand more about their approach that lead to them either succeeding or finding failure.<br>
Also, the campaigns that attempted to raise an amount greater than $50,000 found overwhelming failure but as to by how much?  It doesn’t tell us like the spreadsheet tells us how far skewed or how close they came to the expensive campaign finding success.<br>

**What are some limitations of this dataset?<br>**
The limitation to the dataset is it is very general data, great data for initial discovery but not great for a true deep dive.  What I mean is that I believe the Year column is great, but I immediately think about the background of the economy during those years as well as the slow introduction of social media and its powerful influence between 2009 – 2017.  How much of the campaign was funded from local sources and who much was raised from outside a certain geographical reference.  Do you find more success raising money from a certain age demographic or was money raised from individual vs businesses, I would love to see that breakdown.  Also, when we looked at the filter of Theater, did a certain Playhouse have more success than others or did physical venue not play into the campaign.<br>  
**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br>**
The first chart that jumps out to me when analyzing fundraising success is a bar graph that shows the overall goal and the amount raised.  It would be two tone bar graph that shows the actual percent in the bar that has been raised.<br> 
To add that the above graph, I would add a third axis that show how many backers each type of category of campaign had.  For example, did successful campaigns that have a larger number of backers based on the amount they wanted to raise.  Also, the campaigns that failed – did they not have enough backer contact or not have a strong center of influence when it came to potential donors?
